# QR-code-Generator
I built a simple QR Code Generator app using Python and Tkinter. It lets users enter a message and instantly generates a QR code, which is displayed within the app. This project helped me understand GUI development and image handling using libraries like pyqrcode, Pillow, and tkinter.
